# Working Principle
A boost converter steps up the input voltage to a higher output voltage using an inductor, switch (usually a transistor), diode, and capacitor by storing energy in the inductor during the switch-on phase and releasing it to the output during the switch-off phase.
# Constrction
- When the switch (usually a transistor) is ON, current flows through the inductor, storing energy as a magnetic field.
- When the switch is turned OFF, the inductor releases energy, and the voltage across it adds to the input voltage.
- This combined voltage is directed through a diode to the output capacitor, charging it to a higher voltage.
- The duty cycle of the switch determines the amount of boost, and feedback control is used to maintain a stable output.
# Output
A boost converter steps up a lower input DC voltage to a higher output DC voltage using an inductor, switch, diode, and capacitor.
# Future Improvement
